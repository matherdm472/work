    My bat to ball skills are 100!! Also can I enter a competition for who can throw their bat the furthest??
    Thank you Kevin Mather. I sincerely mean it. You just said what everyone already knew, but now we @MLB_PLAYERS have official evidence that is going to help a lot of players. Again, thank you!! Bravo
    I’d like to say thank you to everyone for the love and support over the years !! I’ve had the opportunity to play with some great teammates and organizations. I wish nothing but the best to the New York Yankees.

    Five straight 100-point games.A record 23-and-0 run. One of the most exciting Women's Final Fours ever. And LSU’s first-ever national basketball title. In this team, we saw hope, pride, and purpose.
    Happy National Ice Cream Day, folks.
    It’s time to finish the job and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Because who in God’s name needs a 100-round magazine on a gun? That's a weapon of war.
    Twelve years ago, I had the honor of being gifted one of the pens President Obama used to sign the Affordable Care Act into law. Today, I gifted one to him as we work to strengthen the law and lower health care costs for hardworking Americans.
    This year, Chile and the United States celebrate 200 years of bilateral relations. And today, our partnership is stronger than it’s ever been.

    I always love "Bring Your Family to Work" Day. My wife, Christine and our two youngest daughters Elizabeth and Bella had a swell time. #StrangerThings #bobnewbysuperhero
    Richard Donner had the biggest, boomiest voice you could imagine. He commanded attention and he laughed like no man has ever laughed before. Dick was so much fun. What I perceived in him, as a 12 year old kid, is that he cared. I love how much he cared.  - Goonies Never Say Die
    By request, here is a photograph of Ali & me. We were in my dressing room on set of The Lord of the Rings. #LOTR She played Eleanor. All grown up now. Pretty please, follow Ali on her brand new twitter account (1 tweet). Singer/Songwriter - Her 1st Album drops on Christmas Eve.
    It’s a great day in America!!! “RUDY” is being re-released in theaters for 2 days :-)))
    Before Rudy, Before Samwise, Before Bob, There was this little guy and a dream. Now, my mom paid for this private dance class, but surely we can all agree, access to arts & music didn’t harm my future!!!

    Who said you can’t dance and renovate at the same time? 😂
    If nothing else, I think this season of #BroVsBro has proven who the more mature twin is... ahem, 💁🏻‍♂️.
    Get ready for a lot of bleeps, a lot of laughs and a lot of Hart. 😄 I don't think I’ve ever laughed so much during demolition. 😂 Catch an all-new #CelebIOU with @KevinHart4Real at 9|8c on @HGTV!
    THIS is how excited I am about the Season 7 premiere of Property Brothers: #ForeverHome tonight

    Grew up watching Jeter play. Always aspired to be the player he was on and off the field. #TheCaptain
    It’s been something special to witness what you’ve accomplished as a teammate. You have put together a season of your own… WELL DESERVED, #SHOTIME!!! #MVP
    It’s hard to sum up into words what these last couple of weeks have meant to me. I had the time of my life representing that USA on my chest! The energy was electric and made the WBC a moment I’ll always cherish. So thank you all so much. It was an honor to be your captain. 🇺🇸
    Very honored to be picked to represent the American League in the All-Star Game. Thank you team and fans for your support. #Angels #VoteGRich
    It’s happening! A dream come true for my family and I to work with @TigerWoods to bring Trout National - The Reserve to our hometown.

    Bulls blow past Magic to claim seventh straight win - No sports league does the holiday season like the NBA, matching the best and most exciting teams against each other.
    Much respect to President Trump and Kim Jong Un for their upcoming historic meeting. I said it back in 2014 that doors will open . #Peace #Love #NotWar
    Thing about my career is this  - numbers don't' lie. Can @HulkHogan out-hustle ME? How does he expect to win Thanksgiving @TheMXCasino?
    At HOF for my boy Scottie Pippen. Congrats my brother!
    Michael Jordan, happy birthday my friend & teammate. You're the greatest basketball player of all time.  Love you bro!

    Happy anniversary, Morgane. Every day is a day I love you more than the day before.
    What a joy to get to perform with Miss Mavis, Maren, Marty & Morgane. Getting to be a part of this performance was a CMA highlight for me.
    The first glass of E.H. Taylor, Jr. I ever had was in the studio. Vance Powell, engineer of both music & good times, brought a bottle to the session for inspiration. That week we recorded an entire album, and that album was Traveller.
    "The Star-Spangled Banner (Live from Super Bowl LVII)" is out now. @NFL @RocNation @EQDistro
    Thank you, @Spotify Listen to "Tennessee Whiskey" on Spotify's 2010s Country playlist.

    I was so excited when @OfficialALW asked me to write an original song with him for @catsmovie. “Beautiful Ghosts” is performed in the film by the extraordinary Francesca Hayward who plays “Victoria” & reprised by Dame Judi Dench (!!!!!) who plays “Old Deuteronomy” 😺 Coming soon!
    Tonight the story continues, as the music video for “willow” drops at midnight eastern.
    Happy Father’s Day to all the dads but mostly mine, who called me yesterday to remind me he still has guitar picks from the Red Tour, ‘if they’re needed’.
    Okay so while my new re-records are NOT done, my friend @VancityReynolds asked me if he could use a snippet of one for a LOLsome commercial he wrote so...here’s a sneak peak of Love Story! Working hard to get the music to you soon!!
    Just had the best time in Denver!! And we got to be the first tour to play in that stadium 2 nights 😝 It’s really hitting me that we only have 3 cities left on the US Eras Tour. This has been my favorite adventure of all. I appreciate and cherish every second of it. See you 🔜 Seattle!!
