    Five straight 100-point games.A record 23-and-0 run. One of the most exciting Women's Final Fours ever. And LSU’s first-ever national basketball title. In this team, we saw hope, pride, and purpose.
    Happy National Ice Cream Day, folks.
    It’s time to finish the job and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Because who in God’s name needs a 100-round magazine on a gun? That's a weapon of war.
    Twelve years ago, I had the honor of being gifted one of the pens President Obama used to sign the Affordable Care Act into law. Today, I gifted one to him as we work to strengthen the law and lower health care costs for hardworking Americans.

    Richard Donner had the biggest, boomiest voice you could imagine. He commanded attention and he laughed like no man has ever laughed before. Dick was so much fun. What I perceived in him, as a 12 year old kid, is that he cared. I love how much he cared.  - Goonies Never Say Die

    It’s hard to sum up into words what these last couple of weeks have meant to me. I had the time of my life representing that USA on my chest! The energy was electric and made the WBC a moment I’ll always cherish. So thank you all so much. It was an honor to be your captain. 🇺🇸
